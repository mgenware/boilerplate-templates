## Scripts

> This project uses [daizong](https://github.com/mgenware/daizong) to manage scripts. You need to run scripts through daizong via `yarn r <script>` or `npm run r <script>`.

### For development

- `yarn r dev` starts the development mode, which watches and compiles all source files including tests files.
- `yarn r t` runs tests in development mode. You can keep two terminal tabs during development, one for `yarn dev`, the other for `yarn r t`.

### For production

- `yarn r build` cleans, lints, compiles the project and runs tests.

### Other scripts

Usually, you do not need to manually run these scripts, they are already integrated into other scripts.

- `yarn r lint` lints the project using ESLint, auto triggered by `yarn r build`.
- `yarn r clean` deletes compiled files, auto triggered by `yarn r dev` or `yarn r build`.

### No `prepublishOnly`

The `prepublishOnly` script was removed, we recommend using [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) to publish packages, which will automatically run `yarn test` before publishing.
